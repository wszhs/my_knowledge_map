<!-- 研究兴趣 -->
## <img src="resume/info.svg" height="20px"> Research Interests
- My research field is **Trustworthy AI for Cyber Security**. My current research interests are game theory-based Adversarial Machine Learning and Explainable Machine Learning for security applications, including network intrusion detection and windows malware detection.
Specifically, my main focuses are transferable and practical adversarial examples generation and improvement of robust generalization with minimax games technology for adversarial training.
Furthermore, I want to explore a series of explanatory methods based on cooperative games for cyber security.

### Current Works
- ETA: Explainable and Transferable Adversarial Attack for ML-Based Network Intrusion Detectors.
  - **H. Zhang**, D. Hang, Y. Liu, Z. Wang
  - [[ETA](https://github.com/wszhs/Cyber-Security-ML-Toolbox/blob/master/ETA.md)] is a Explainable Transfer-based black-box adversarial Attack framework aiming to 1) craft transferable adversarial examples across various types of ML models and 2) explain why adversarial examples and adversarial transferability exist in NIDSs.

- CARE: Ensemble Adversarial Robustness Evaluation Against Adaptive Attackers for Security Applications.
  - **H. Zhang**, Y. Liu, J. Sun, J. Liu
  - [[CARE](https://github.com/wszhs/Cyber-Security-ML-Toolbox/blob/master/CARE.md)] is a general Cybersecurity Adversarial Robustness Evaluation (CARE) platform aiming to comprehensively evaluates the defense effectiveness of model ensembles and ensemble defenses against adaptive attackers. 
  
- BayesAttack: Query-Efficient End-to-end Adversarial Attacks against Security Detectors via Bayesian Optimization.
  - **H. Zhang**, D. Hang, Y. Liu, Z. Wang
  - [[BayesAttack](https://github.com/wszhs/Cyber-Security-ML-Toolbox/blob/master/BayesAttack.md)] is a practical bayesian Optimization-based adversarial attack framework aiming to address two critical requirements in practice: 1) achieving a query-effective black-box attack, 2) directly modifying the original entities, and meeting problem-space constraints.
