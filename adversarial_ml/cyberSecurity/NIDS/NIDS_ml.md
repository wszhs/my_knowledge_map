# ML-based Network Intrusion Detection 
Artificial intelligence technology has been utilized in NIDSs design to improve detection accuracy and efficiency.

## Anomaly Detection Models
In recent years, anomaly-based ML methods have gained popularity because they allow the detection of zero-day threats.
As a classic example, Mirsky et al.\cite{mirsky2018kitsune} developed KitNET, an online unsupervised anomaly detector based on an ensemble of auto-encoders that characterizes anomalies by using reconstruction errors.
Following that, \cite{marteau2021random} presented DiFF-RF, an ensemble approach based on random partitioning binary trees that can detect point-wise and collective anomalies.
To summarize, ML-based NIDSs play an important role in detecting malicious activities in networks.
